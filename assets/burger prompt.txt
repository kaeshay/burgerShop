Hello!!

I'm curating a bunch of weird/wacky/silly burger ingredients so that the Tiny Town children can make their own burgers and celebrate a kid's birthday this Saturday. Would you be able to send me a burger ingredient and a sound that the ingredient would make? You can totally make something up like jelly seeds and denim patties.


Should only take you a minute or two. Totally okay if your hands are full this week! Let me know! Also, please send it to me via email at kay.liang@outlook.com (as I cannot download audio messages from messenger). I've attached some demos but please put your own twist and go crazy <3
